// Dice Roller
// Using what we've learned about the Math library in js, complete the following
// function that should return a value between 1 through 6 at random (1 and 6 inclusive)
function d6() {
    var roll = Math.random(); // remember, this is going to be anywhere between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (not inclusive)
    
    // at this point, roll is a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (not inclusive), but we want it to be somewhere between 1 and 6.
    // So, let's multiply the result by 6 to start.
    roll *= 6;

    // now, roll is some number between 0 and 5.999999...
    // So we need to round it. Let's look at our options.
    // Math.ceil -- roll is between 0 and 6, whole numbers only. that's tough, because we don't want 0, but we want 6.
    // Math.floor -- roll is between 0 and 5, whole numbers only. this is going to be our best option, because adding 1 to the 
    // result wil give us between 1 and 6, whole numbers only!
    roll = Math.floor(roll) + 1;

    return roll;

    // Bonus: Do it in one line!!
    return Math.floor(Math.random()*6) + 1;
